# Udacity Robotics Nanodegree

All of the notes I've written for the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree is stored here.

The actual project code is stored in individual repositories.

The scripts used to setup the Jupyter Notebook environment is also stored here. This activates the `RoboND` conda environment, so the notebooks can access the appropriate libraries. You can install the Anaconda environment by following the instructions [here](../master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md).
