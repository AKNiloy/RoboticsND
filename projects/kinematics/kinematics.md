# Kinematics

This section focuses on learning kinematic basics of rotation matrices, displacement vectors and homogeneous transformations.

The section project involved programming the logic behind a Kuka KR210 6 degree of freedom manipulator. The task involved calculating the inverse kinematics to move the gripper to a can's location on a shelf, grabbing the can, then calculating the inverse kinematic movement to drop the can into a box on the side.
