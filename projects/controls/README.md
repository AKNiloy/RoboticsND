# Control

Robot control involves the process of managing how the robotic system physically moves. It is important to develop control algorithms for a robotic system because they allow the system to react to different environmental and system changes in real time.

The main controller type used is the *proportional-integral-derivative* controller, or PID controller. It is a control loop feedback mechanism that is widely used in industrial control systems. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired set point and a measured process variable, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and/or derivative terms.
