Topic: Designed and built one of the fastest quadruped robots under 30 kg

### Leg Designs
There are many designs for legged robots. They are often separated by how many segments they are. The most basic designs includes a single hip joint and a telescopic mechanism (spring or hydraulic/pneumatic cylinder). A two-segment design would include a hip joint and a knee joint (possibly using a torsion spring). A three-segment design would utilize some type of ankle joint in addition to the hip and knee joint. Finally, a four-segment design would include the addition of a foot joint.
