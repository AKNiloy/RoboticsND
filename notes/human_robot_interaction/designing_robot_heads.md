# Designing Robot Heads

[All Robots Are Not Created Equal: The Design and Perception of Humanoid Robot Heads](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/2002pdfs/2002DiSalvo.robots%20unequal.pdf)

What features and dimensions of a humanoid robot's face most dramatically contribute to people's perception of its humanness? Analyzed 48 robots and conducted surveys to measure people's perception of its humanness. The research found that the presence of certain features, the dimensions of the head, and the total number of facial features heavily influence the perception of humanness in robot heads.

Many robotics researchers are pursuing a humanoid robot form as the most appropriate form for a social robot, assuming that implicitly the head will be the primary place of human-robot interaction.

### Survey Robots

Images of 48 robots were used. The three robot categories were created include:
- Educational and industrial research robots (18 samples)
- Consumer product robots (14 samples)
- Fictional robots (16 samples)

### Findings

#### Presence of Features

The presence of specific facial features account for 62% of the variance in the perception of humanness in humanoid robot heads.

The features that increase the perception of humanness the most are the:
- nose
- eyelids
- mouth

The total number of features on the robot's head is significant in the perception of humanness. The more features the robot head has, the more human like it will be perceived.

#### Dimensions of the head and features

None of the dimensions of the facial features are individually significant in the perception of humanness in robot heads.

However, the width of the head is significant. The wider the head compared with the height, the less human-like the head is perceived.

#### Actual Robot Closeness to Humans

The majority of robots were not rated as being very human-like. The raises the issue of how human-like a robot can be perceived by form alone. Humanness will be defined not only by form but interactions through expression, communication and behavior.

#### Differences Between Categories

Fictional robots were on perceived as the most human-like, whereas consumer product robots were rated as the least human-like. The difference was not large, but a trend exists to make consumer product robots appear more robotic than human. This trend might be due to technical constraints of creating a robot for everyday use or reflects the actual preference of users.

### Suggestions for Physical Designs

Three physical design suggestions were identified, including that the robot needs to:
- Retain an amount of robot-ness so that the user does not develop false expectations of the robots emotional abilities but realizes its machine capabilities
- Project an amount of humanness so that the user will feel comfortable socially engaging the robot
- Convey an amount of product-ness so that the user will feel comfortable using the robot

Together, these suggestions create a balance between what we expect of a human, a robot, and a product for an effective design.

#### Wide head, wide eyes

To retain a certain amount of robot-ness, by making the robot look less human, the head should be slightly wider than it is tall and the eye space should be slightly wider than the diameter of the eye.

#### Features that dominate the face

The feature set, from browline to bottom of mouth, should dominate the face. Proportionally, less space should be given to forehead, hair, jaw or chin. This contrasts humans, but will clearly make the head look robot-like.

#### Complexity and detail in the eyes

To project humanness, a robot must have eyes, and the eyes should include some complexity in surface detail, shape of the eye, eyeball, iris and pupil.

#### Four or more features

The presence of a nose, a mouth, and eyebrows greatly contribute to the perception of humanness.

#### Skin

For a robot to appear as a consumer product it must appear finished. A skin or casing achieves this by covering the mechanical substructure and electrical components.

#### Humanistic form language

The head shape should be organic in form with complex curves in the forehead, back head and cheek areas.
