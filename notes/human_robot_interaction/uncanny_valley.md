# The Uncanny Valley: The Original Essay by Masahiro Mori

Masahiro hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance; the uncanny valley.

### Uncanny

When a person looses their sense of affinity to an object (robot).

With prosthetic hands, when we realize the hand, which at first site looked real, is in fact artificial, we experience an eerie sensation. For example, we could be startled during a handshake by its limp boneless grip together with its texture and coldness.

In mathematical terms, this can be represented by a negative value on the affinity scale, where the humanlike value would still rate high. This places the hand near the bottom of the valley.

Healthy humans are at the crest of the second peak, however, when we die, our death can be regarded as a movement from the second peak (moving) to the bottom of the uncanny valley (still).

### Factors

#### Movement

The presence of movement changes the shape of the uncanny valley graph by amplifying the peaks and valleys. For humanoids, the velocity, acceleration and deceleration must approximate human movement.

For example, one robot designed for the 1970s World Exposition in Osaka, Japan had 29 pairs of artificial muscles in the face (the same number as a human being) to make it smile in a human-like fashion. When the speed of certain muscle movements is cut in half in an attempt to make the robot bring up a smile more slowly, instead of looking happy, its expression turns creepy.

#### Design

Recommend that designers take the first peak as their goal, which results in a moderate degree of human likeness and a considerable sense of affinity. This will limit the risk inherent in trying to increase the degree of human likeness to scale the second peak.

It might be possible to create a safe level of affinity by deliberately pursuing a nonhuman design. A model of human hands on statues of Buddhas made with freely bending finger joints does not elicit any eerie sensation by using the naturally color of wood and round, beautiful curves.

### Purpose in Humans

The uncanny valley appears to be an ingrained response in humans. Is it essential for humans, and how integral is it for our instinct for self-preservation?

Understanding the uncanny valley is important for creating devices to which people can relate comfortably.
